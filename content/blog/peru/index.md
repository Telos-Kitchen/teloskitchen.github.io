The Ministry of Agriculture of Peru began an Hancock implementation to support for over 15,000 coffee and cacao cooperative farmers. Over a dozen independent farming organizations are joined together in a cooperative. They vote to elect representatives to operate the cooperative and make decisions on behalf of the group.

Like organizations around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has made assembling in person much more challenging, accelerating the need to operate the business remotely.
