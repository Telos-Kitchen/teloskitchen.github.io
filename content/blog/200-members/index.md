Hypha, a Hancock launch partner, has grown to over 200 members. There are many open applications for new members, but the enrollers have tempered the member growth rate in order to improve the onboarding process. 

Before applying for a role, new members are encouraged to propose or apply for a short-term quest. A quest provides the member with an experience of working in a decentralized organization to see if they like it, learn the ropes, and give the other members a chance to evaluate their potential.

Similar to a bounty, a quest has a two-part voting process where the community first approves the scope and budget. Then, after the quest has been completed, the community again votes to dispatch the funds to the successful participant.
